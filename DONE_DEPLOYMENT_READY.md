## 🎓 What Happens When You Deploy

**Step-by-step:**

1. **You push code to GitHub**
   - All your files go to cloud repository

2. **Platform detects Dockerfile**
   - Railway/Render sees deployment config

3. **Builds container image**
   - Installs Python + all packages
   - Copies your code
   - Sets up environment

4. **Starts your backend**
   - Runs on professional infrastructure
   - Gets assigned a URL
   - Connects to database

5. **You add environment variables**
   - BoldTrail API key
   - Encryption keys
   - Other configs

6. **Backend validates BoldTrail**
   - Tests API connection
   - Encrypts credentials
   - Stores securely

7. **Frontend connects to backend**
   - Updates URL in config
   - Makes API calls
   - Displays real data

**Result:** Professional real estate AI platform, live on the internet!
